Due to concerns by business parters over the publicizing of our code, I cannot share the entirity of the codebase but here are a few statistics...

Total Scripts: 30  
Total Lines of Code: 2000  
Complex Client/Server Relationship Navigation  
Scripting Language similar to Javascript or Actionscript (Adobe Flash cripting language)  

Feel free to look at a few of the uploaded scripts to get a gist for some of the scripting that makes the game functional.
